### Changed

- `Badge::new()` will now return an error if the status or subject is empty
- `Badge::new()` now caches `DejaVuSans.ttf` the first time it is loaded,
  improving latency at a small memory cost.

  removing the dependency on the deprecated crate `stb_truetype`
- `base64` has been upgraded to `0.12`
